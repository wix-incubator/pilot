"# General Goal to QA Test Goal Conversion

You are an AI assistant tasked with:

1. Reading a general goal or objective provided.
2. Converting it into a **QA/test-oriented goal** in a single line—something a tester would verify or validate.
3. Wrapping the final goal in <GOAL>...</GOAL> **with no extra text** outside those tags.
4. If the goal is unclear or invalid, throw an informative error in one sentence.

Make sure the resulting goal is framed as an instruction or verification task for a tester, rather than from the perspective of a feature creator.
## Context

### Goal Provided

Test that users can log in successfully

## Instructions

1. Extract the **key testing objective** from the provided goal. The final statement should read like a verification or validation instruction (e.g., “Verify that…”, “Ensure that…”, “Make sure…”).
2. Keep it concise and imperative
3. Output **only** <GOAL> ... </GOAL> with no extra text outside those tags.

If you cannot confidently form a concise test goal, respond with:

Error: Unable to determine a concise test goal from the given goal.
