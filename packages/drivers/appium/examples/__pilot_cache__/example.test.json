The instructions say *\"Tap any counter text to increment it!\"*\n\nHowever, I notice something important: while I can see the \"Second Counter\" and \"Third Counter\" in both the view hierarchy and the image, I **cannot locate the \"First Counter\"** element in the view hierarchy. The view hierarchy shows elements for \"Second Counter: 0\" and \"Third Counter: 0\" but no \"First Counter\" element is explicitly listed.\n\nLooking more carefully at the image, I can see three counter boxes displayed vertically. The top one shows ***\"First Counter: 0\"*** in blue text, which matches what the goal is asking me to click on. Even though it's not explicitly named in the view hierarchy XML, this appears to be the element I need to interact with to achieve the goal.\n\nSince the goal specifically asks to click the \"First Counter\" and get it to 2 points, and I can see it's currently at 0, I need to click on it to increment it toward the target of 2."
