But from the screenshot, I can clearly see there are three counter boxes, and the top one shows ***\"First Counter: 0\"***. \n\nThe instruction at the bottom says *\"Tap any counter text to increment it!\"* which confirms these counters are interactive. Since the goal is to get the First Counter to 2 points, I need to click on it twice, but first I need to click it once to increment it from 0 to 1.\n\nLooking at the visual layout, the First Counter appears to be the topmost counter box in the interface, even though it's not explicitly listed as a separate element in the XML hierarchy. This might be because it's contained within the larger parent element that contains all the counter text."

However, I notice that the view hierarchy doesn't show a specific clickable element for \"First Counter: 1\" like it does for the Second and Third counters. This suggests that the First Counter element might not be properly captured in the hierarchy, but based on the visual layout and the instruction text \"Tap any counter text to increment it!\", the First Counter should be clickable and positioned above the Second Counter.\n\nSince the goal requires getting to exactly 2 points and we're currently at 1, **one more tap** on the First Counter should achieve the goal."
